# Hey Friends!

## üßä First off a little about me

Software Development to me is solving one hundred different problems; one step at a time. And solving problems feeds my soul.

üéì I am Cody Swithenbank, a **Fullstack Web Developer** (**React Applications** with **Express Servers**, **Postgres** databases on **Node.js**). I have completed Fullstack Academy of Code's Bootcamp and am ready to change the world!

‚å®Ô∏è In 2021, I began my journey into code, learning all the fundamentals of web development and building projects with teams, centered on full-stack JavaScript development, including Node.js, Express, Sequelize ORM for PostgreSQL databases, React and Redux; along with HTML & CSS, and CS fundamentals. After the bootcamp I began my self-studying by learning **Next.js**, **GraphQL**, **D3.js**, **Vue.js**, **goLang** and **Blockchain development & DApps**.

üßòüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Outside the tech world, I love to constantly learn and develop those rounding skills. My hobbies include (but not limited to) **Yoga**, **Digital Art**, **Painting**, **Gaming** and **Cooking**.

üìñ I also love reading books on **personal development**, **philosophy** and **fiction**. My favorite ones are **The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are** by _Alan Watts_, **Island** by _Aldous Huxley_ and **Dune** by _Frank Herbert_.

# Background of the Hero

A little and fun library called [pts](https://ptsjs.org/)!

A note from the pts website:

> _Like seeing the Big Dipper in a sky full of stars, Pts helps you connect the dots in the vastness of conceptual spaces._ > _Pts enables you to compose and express what you see in your mind's eyes ‚Äî points as ideas, shapes, colors, motions, interactions, and more._

Check `lib/TemplateCanvas.js` for the base conversion from the general pts library to be able to be used in a react component.

That template is then extended to the component in `components/HeroPts.js` which adds the individual properties and points. I tried to keep the comments in that section detailed enough to follow what is going on!
